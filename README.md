# Genesis 1:3 (KJV)

"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light"

# Daniel 2:43-44

"And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay."

"And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever."

# Genesis 11:6-7

"And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do."

"Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one anotherâ€™s speech."
